    <h1> Enhancing Biomedical Content Authoring Through Knowledge Representation</h1>
    
</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p> 
        There is a plethora of biomedical documents available to read on the internet. However, a significant majority of these texts are unstructured and lack semantic metadata that gives context for search engines to retrieve more precise information. To ameliorate this problem, many semantic annotators have been developed such as NCBO and RYSannMD.
        Even so, these annotators still struggle to achieve optimal accuracy and speed metrics with their approaches to biomedical semantic content annotation. For our use case, we have introduced a knowledge graph with an nlp-enhanced search query approach that allows users to choose prominent semantic annotation recommended by the domain through a socio-technical and personalized approach. We have implemented this approach in "Semantically", a biomedical content semantic annotation site which provides a knowledge graph based annotation system 
    </p>

    <p> This page is meant to present the current workflow and functionalities of the system, both using a social-technical approach and a social-technical approach with a knowledge graph based recommendation system enhancement.  Below you will see the workflow of the system with and without the knowledge graph tab.</p>
