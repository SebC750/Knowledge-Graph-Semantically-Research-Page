      <p class="abstract-content">
        There is a plethora of biomedical documents available to read on the internet. However, a significant majority
        of these texts are unstructured and lack semantic metadata that gives context for search engines to retrieve
        more precise information. To ameliorate this problem, many semantic annotators have been developed such as NCBO
        and RYSannMD.
        Even so, these annotators still struggle to achieve optimal accuracy and speed metrics with their approaches to
        biomedical semantic content annotation. For our use case, we have introduced a knowledge graph based recommendation system approach that allows users to choose prominent semantic annotation recommended by the
        domain through a socio-technical and personalized approach. We have implemented this approach in "Semantically",
        a biomedical content semantic annotation platform to enhance semantic annotation of biomedical texts and embed
        it into the heading of documents for more accurate data retrieval.
      </p>

      <p class="abstract-content"> This page is meant to present the current workflow and functionalities of the system,
        showing the diffrent approaches such as using a social-technical approach, personalized approach and a knowledge graph based
        recommendation system enhancement. Below you will see the workflow of the system with the knowledge graph tab.

            <h2> Biomedical Semantic Annotation process + Social Technical Approach + Personalized Approach</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="col" align="center">
            

            <p> This is the demo for the social-technical approach. This approach was implemented to enhance the process of biomedical semantic annotation by involving other users/domain experts in the semantic annotation process. 
              By creating an enviroment in which users can seek for assistance from a community or other experts, the social-technical approach significantly improves the ease and accuracy of annotating by asking for help from qualified users with finding the best ontologies for embedding relevant context for a given term.
                
            </p>
            <p> For demonstration purposes, the following videos show an example of how a user may engage in the
              semantic annotation process through a social-technical approach. The steps demonstrated are as follows:
            </p>
            <h3> Social-Technical Recommendation </h3>
            <div align="left">
              <ul>
                <li>
                 
                  <h3> Step 1: </h3>  <p>The user selects a specific annotation in their document: "virus-replication-cycle".
                  This opens an option to ask a social technical question or personalized recommendation. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  
                  <h3> Step 2:</h3> <p>A prompt will open where the user can select one of three questions for the selected
                  term:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p>"Which ontology should I use?"</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>"What is the suitable ontology vocabulary?"</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>"Does this ontology best describe this terminology?"</p>
                    </li>

                  </ul>

                  <p> The user also provides a description of what exactly they need. Once submitted, the post is
                    publicized in the Semantically Cafe Forum.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  
                  <h3> Step 3:</h3> <p>Other domain experts and users respond by suggesting recommendations for ontologies.
                  Users will also give themselves confidence_scores and explanations for their suggestions. In the
                  videos featured below, two recommendations are made with different responses and confidence scores.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  
                  <h3> Step 4:</h3> <p>After responses are submitted, the original user can select the same term again
                  (virus-replication-cycle) and see the new recommendations after clicking on the "New Recommendation"
                  link that appears.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  
                  <h3>Step 5: </h3><p> The user opens a prompt showing the responses given by the other domain experts. The
                  user has the option to choose between accepting or rejecting the recommendation. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <p> If <span class="accept">accepted</span>, the user is prompted to give a rating from 1 to 5.
                        The ontology and definition is then updated according to the accepted recommendation. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <p>If <span class="reject">rejected</span>, the prompt is closed and the original ontology of the
                        term remains unchanged. </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3> Personalized Recommendation </h3>
              <p> Users may also have the option of seeking help from specific domain experts that are relevant to the biomedical subdomain that you are seeking help for. When a user selects the personalized recommendation option, a prompt will appear displaying a table of the most relevant users, based on weighted score and similarity score. </p>
              <ul>
                <li> <p>  Cosine Similarity: For the personalized approach, the cosine similarity is obtained by the formula shown below, where a represents the author embedding vectors and u represents the user embedding vectors.</p> <img src="/media/images/cosine_similarity.png"></li>
                <li> <p>  Weighted score: The weighted score is obtained from the product of the cosine similarity and the mean score.</p> <img src="/media/images/weighted_score.png"></li>
              </ul>
              <p> The cosine similarity scores are then used to sort descending order where the 5 topmost experts are the most relevant experts for the user. After selecting the expert, the user is then prompted to ask a question to the expert and submit. </p>
            </div>
            <p> The following videos demonstrate a scenario where a user seeks a personalized recommendation for the term "Inflammatory Mediators". The second video specifically shows that the targeted domain expert receives the directed post under their direct post tab.</p>

            <div class="col" align="center">
              
                <p>In this section, we provide videos/images of the demonstration for the Knowledge Graph Recommendation System process. The Knowledge Graph is meant to further enhance the process by providing a search functionality that enables users to look for the best recommendations, domain experts and best suggestions for ontologies. A knowledge graph with detailed information of the best recommendations retrieved is generated to provide a clear visualization and representation of annotations/recommendations.</p>
                <p>In the social-technical approach video demo shown above, some user recommendations were given for the term "virus-replication-cycle". In the following video, a search query for this term in the knowledge graph tab shows the graph visualization and recommendation rankings.</p>
                <p> The step-by-step process of knowledge graph recommendation querying is as follows: </p>
                <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li> <h3> Step 1: </h3> <p> Select a search type (user, medical term or ontology)</p></li>
                  <li> <h3> Step 2: </h3> <p> Input your search query. </p></li>
                  <li> <h3> Step 3: </h3> <p> Submit to generate the knowledge graph. </p></li>
                </ul>
              </div>
                <h3> Scoring system </h3>
                <p> In order for a recommendation system to return the best recommendations for their purposes, an accurate scoring system is needed to convert critical reception of recommendations into an accurate form of ranking. The formula is as follows: </p>
                <img  src="/media/images/score_calc.png" alt="Description of the image">
                <span> * </span>
                <div align="left">
                <ul>
                  <li> <h3> Step 1: </h3> <p> The wilson score is calculated first, using the total upvotes and total votes with the given formula </p> <img  src="/media/images/wilson_score.png" alt="Description of the image"> <p> Where p^ is the number of upvotes divided by the total number of votes and n is the total number of votes. </p></li>
                  <li> <h3> Step 2: </h3> <p> Take the confidence score and rating (if any) and normalize the values. </p></li>
                  <li> <h3> Step 3: </h3> <p> Add the wilson score with the normalized confidence score and rating score. Then divide by 3. </p></li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div> <p> <span class="warning">UPDATE:</span> After some feedback, the scoring system has been reevaluated to account for the potential bias that can result from a self-evaluation score. The values now have weights, with confidence scores having the lowest weight (0.20) to the wilson score and rating score (0.40). This helps to ensure that confidence scores, which can be overestimated/underestimated by domain experts, have less sway over which recommendations are prioritized over others.</p></div>

                        <p> In this video, the user searches for a specific user/domain expert. The knowledge graph tab returns a knowledge graph of all the responses and ontological suggestions made by the domain expert. It returns information such as: </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li> <p> Ontologies the user has suggested.</p> </li>
                          <li> <p> The replies from which these ontologies were suggested.</p></li>

                            The domain expert search function is useful for users to determine which users are most reliable in general or for a given biomedical subdomain.
